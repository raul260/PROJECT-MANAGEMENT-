# PROJECT-MANAGEMENT-
Fundamentals of Project Management concepts, practices, and behavioral characteristics needed to successfully launch, lead, and realize benefits from projects in profit and nonprofit organizations. Effective project managers possess the skills necessary to manage teams, schedules, risks, budgets, scope, and stakeholders to produce a desired outcome. Students analyze the impact of organizational change management theory and explore project management with a practical, hands-on approach through case studies, team assignments, and individual contributions. A key and often overlooked challenge for project managers is the ability to manage without direct influence, gaining the support of stakeholders and access to resources not directly under their control. Special attention is given to critical success factors required to overcoming resistance to change. The course simulates a project in its project team framework, group accountability, and schedule deadlines.
